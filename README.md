# Info Site / React Vite Example Test Project

## An example About Me project referencing Scrimba's React course written in React using Vite to scaffold.

This project is an example that was built along with a course on Scrimba showing how to create React applications using Vite. Every part of this project is sample code which shows how to do the following:

* Scaffold a React project using Vite
* Creating and organizing modular components within the project's repository
* Assemble a functional web application out of separate components

My key takeaway from completing this project was the sheer speed and ease of setting up a React project using Vite. Having mainly used Create React App as an environment to develop React applications, Vite surprised me with how quickly I was able to set up a project and begin development. After seeing the convenience and efficiency of using Vite, I will continue to progress through the Scrimba course while using Vite to create and work on my own projects.
